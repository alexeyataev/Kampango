        <p class="intro_text margin-bottom_full-rem">Now's a great time to join the community, and become part of the NCT.</p>

        <p class="margin-bottom_full-rem">Being the UK’s largest charity for parents - established for more than 60 years - also means we’re the UK’s largest community of new parents.</p>
        <p class="margin-bottom_full-rem">Becoming a new parent is an incredible journey with so many highs and some lows, being part of a community helps to combat the feeling of isolation and can enhance the journey by sharing with minded friends.</p>
        <p class="margin-bottom_full-rem">By becoming an NCT member, you join thousands of parents that have formed lifelong friendships and support networks. Through us, they’ve shared experiences, excitement and inspiration during some of the most amazing times of their lives – and beyond.</p>
        <p class="margin-bottom_full-rem">Your membership donation will support our work in your community, and in local communities across the UK.</p>
