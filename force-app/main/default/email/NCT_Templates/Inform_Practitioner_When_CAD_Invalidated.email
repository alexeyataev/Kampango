Dear {!Course_Assignment__c.OwnerFirstName},
<br>
<br>
We’re writing to let you know that this Course Assignment Document is no longer up-to-date and has been invalidated. This is either because some of the course or fee details have changed, in which case a new Course Assignment Document will be issued to you in due course, or because we’ve had to make the difficult decision to cancel the course.
<br> 
<br>
If you have any questions about this please contact the Capacity PSA using the email address at the bottom of this email.
<br> 
<br>
Kind Regards,  
<br>
