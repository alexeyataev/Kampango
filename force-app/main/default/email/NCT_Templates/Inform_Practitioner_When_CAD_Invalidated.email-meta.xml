    <subject>Invalidation of NCT Course Assignment document for {!Course_Assignment__c.PSA_Area__c}/{!Course_Assignment__c.Course__c}</subject>
    <textOnly>Dear {!Course_Assignment__c.OwnerFirstName},

We’re writing to let you know that this Course Assignment Document is no longer up-to-date and has been invalidated. This is either because some of the course or fee details have changed, in which case a new Course Assignment Document will be issued to you in due course, or because we’ve had to make the difficult decision to cancel the course.

If you have any questions about this please contact the Capacity PSA using the email address at the bottom of this email.

Kind Regards,

{!Course_Assignment__c.LastModifiedBy}
